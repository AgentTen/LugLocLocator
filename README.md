Android LugLoc Locator
===================================

This is just a basic app that demonstrates how to use the Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)
to find the nearest LugLoc devices and get their bluetooth IDs.

Introduction
------------

This sample shows a list of available LugLoc Bluetooth LE devices and provides
an interface to get the bluetooth IDs associated with the devices.

It creates a [Service][1] for managing connection and data communication with a GATT server
hosted on a given Bluetooth LE device.

The Activities communicate with the Service, which in turn interacts with the [Bluetooth LE API][2].
